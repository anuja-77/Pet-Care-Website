            <h2 id="item-1" >Pet Feeding</h2>
            <p class="item_content">We know our pets need a healthy & nutritious diet to live a happy & fulfilling life. To stay fit, they need exercise & an equally good diet. It is important to strike a balance between the two. But how do we know if we are able to fulfill our pet’s
                nutritional needs? What all needs to be taken care of? 
                Do pets need a balanced diet too?  
                Yes. Just like us, our pets also need a balanced diet. An imbalanced diet can cause 
                chronic & severe heart & liver problems in pets. Our pets are carnivores in nature. They have evolved from wild animals but due to their domestication, their needs have changed. Although a diet is usually prescribed depending upon the age, height, weight, breed, etc, few nutrients are essential for their well being -

            <h2 id="item-2">Pet Grooming</h2>
            <p>
                When most people think about pet grooming, they conjure up images of bows, brushes, and running after their pets. Others have the misconception that pet grooming is not necessary. However, it is an important aspect of a pet’s overall well-being and health. Pet grooming is important for the whole family as well. You do not want your dirty and smelly pet jumping on your couch or clean bedsheets.
                With proper pet grooming, you will get rid of shedding, fleas, ticks, and various health conditions.
                 Proper grooming is more than just having a cute pet. </p>
                 <h4 id="item-2-1">Prevention & Detection</h4><br>
                 <p><h5> Grooming Maintains Healthy Coat and Fur</h5><br>
                    To maintain his or her fur and coat, you simply need to brush him or her.
                    Any seasoned pet owner will tell you that brushing your pet will benefit him or her greatly. 
                    It will also strengthen your bond, in addition to helping to avoid mats in his or her fur.
                    <h5><br>Grooming Can Help Prevent Joint Pain</h5><br>
One of the most important parts of grooming is caring for your pet’s nails. Your pet may experience joint pain as a
 result of uncut nails. This is because he or she will have to walk with misaligned pads.
                    <h5><br>It Encourages Positive Behavior</h5><br>
 This is one of the most important benefits of regular pet grooming. If you groom your pet regularly, it will affect his or her mental health positively. A good-smelling, good-looking pet is a joy to be around. The positive reinforcement your pet will receive from people will affect his or her mental state, which will improve his or her behavior as well.
